# Spending-Income Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. It helps businesses understand customer groups and target marketing strategies accordingly.

## 📊 Overview

The script performs unsupervised learning on the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset to identify distinct clusters of customers using the following steps:

- Data loading and exploration
- Feature selection: Annual Income & Spending Score
- Optimal cluster number selection using the Elbow Method
- K-Means clustering model training
- Visualization of customer segments

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Concepts

- Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method (WCSS)
- Data Visualization

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used is [`Mall_Customers.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers), containing details such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## 📷 Output

The final output includes:
- Elbow graph to determine optimal clusters
- Scatter plot visualizing 5 customer clusters with centroids

## 💡 Applications

- Customer segmentation for targeted marketing
- Personalized promotions
- Understanding customer behavior patterns
